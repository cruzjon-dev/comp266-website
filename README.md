# FlashStash
FlashStash is my project for COMP 266 at Athabasca University.

## Website Description

FlashStash is a study platform that provides users with the ability to manage and organize collections of flashcards. It aims to provide learners with a centralized hub of information on the various courses or studies they are undertaking. Users can note down key information within flashcards and revisit them for reviewal to aid in retaining what they’ve studied.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.  
  
API integration: to be determined.

## Limitations

Due to the minimalistic tech stack and lack of backend server, the website is limited to using the browser's local storage in place of a database.
