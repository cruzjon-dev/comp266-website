				<h1>About FlashStash</h1>
				<p>FlashStash is a study platform that provides users with the ability to manage and organize collections of flashcards. It aims to provide learners with a centralized hub of information on the various courses or studies they are undertaking. Users can note down key information within flashcards and revisit them for reviewal to aid in retaining what they've studied.</p>

				<details>
					<summary><h2>How do I use the website?</h2></summary>
					<p>To get started, <a href="/flashcards.html" target="_blank">go to the "My Flashcards" page</a> and create your first flashcard set. A flashcard set is effectively a category in which you can place flashcards under. This helps keep your flashcards organized. Once you've created a set, you can click the set and start creating flashcards within the set. You will be prompted to enter a question or a term. The question/term you enter will be saved and will be displayed on the front side of the flashcard. Next, you will be prompted to enter the answer or definition to the respective question or term you entered. The answer/definition you enter will be displayed on the back side of the flashcard.</p>
					<p>After you've created your flashcards, you can utilize your flashcards to recap what you've studied. You can quiz yourself by attempting to answer the question or define the term presented on a given flashcard. You can then verify if you answered correctly by flipping the flashcard to its back side (clicking on a flashcard flips it to its opposite side).</p>

					<h3>Be Organized</h3>
					<p>We recommend being as organized as possible with your flashcards. Label your flashcard sets appropriately. You can also add tags to your flashcards to further categorize them. For example, you can choose to create individual flashcard sets for every course you are taking. Then, use the unit numbers or topics in the course as tags for the flashcards under that given course.</p>

					<h3>Keep It Concise</h3>
					<p>Keep the information you store in flashcards concise. This helps you focus on the most important information or key concepts. If the topic is too difficult, you can optionally add hints in the frontside of your flashcards (University of Toronto Scarborough, n.d.).</p>

					<h3>Actively Recall</h3>
					<p>Instead of memorizing the information or answers, try to digest the underlying concept and explain it in your own words. This promotes active learning and helps you retain the information better (Cohen, n.d.).</p>
